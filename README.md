## Define the prediction problem:
  Classification problem : Classify the patients into (Patient has Parkinson | Patient does not have Parkinson) using the attributes from their voice recordings
  
##  About Dataset :
UCI ML Parkinson’s dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/ )

The dataset has 24 columns and 195 records.It is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195-voice recording from these individuals. The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.
